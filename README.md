## Set-up

### But Before that...

Never forget to clone this project and install needed dependencies!

### Environments

Replace the `example.env` file name to `.env` then replace all variable values to your own.

### Running on

#### Production

Compiling and Running is as easy as two commands!

```
npm run build
```

and

```
npm run start
```

#### Development

If you want it to run and rerun per edit:

The command

```
npm run build:watch
```

will compile your TypeScript code per edit while

```
npm run start:dev
```

will rerun the compiled code on every compilation (using nodemon)!
